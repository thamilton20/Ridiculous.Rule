      <h1>The Most Ridiculous Rule(s)</h1>
      <h2> By Taylor Hamilton </h2>
    <p> One time for a class I needed to find the most ridiculous rule that I have ever encountered. Obviously I went to the <br>
      handbook to look and I found out that at Padua you are not allowed to wear head bands that are wider than 2" and you can <br>
      not have unnatural hair colors or hairstyles.The reason that I thought these rules were ridiculous is becuase its your hair <br>
      and you should be able to do whatever you want with it. In conclusion, why do schools have so much control over the color of <br>
      your hair or the way you want to wear it.</p>
